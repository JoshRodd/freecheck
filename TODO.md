TODO LIST
=========

Things to do, in no particular order:

- Fix all the regexp problems that are surely in there
- Allow for a global config file, and a personal config file
- Allow some defaults to be set in the config file to shorten command line
- Tweak PostScript to make sure nothing falls in the "forbidden" MICR area
- Print receipts or whatever on check blanks that allow space for that
- Command-line options for payee, date, memo, and amount
  (Print out entire, filled out check, not just empty)
- Write a GUI around this thing
- Get more check blank definitions
- Include a --print option on command line
- Include a --pdf option on command line
- Add Document Structuring Convention stuff to the PS file

And finally...
- Convince someone to have the output professionally tested.
