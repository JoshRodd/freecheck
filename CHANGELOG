        % updated files, filenames, and added AGPL 3.0 license
        thanks to Artifex Ghostscript's enscript making this subject
        to it
        % ported `freecheck` from Perl to Python
        % removed old CGI program
        % updated documentation
        + freecheck.py: freecheck.cfg is now TOML-format, freecheck.toml
        % freecheck.py doesn't bump the check number in freecheck.toml
        - freecheck.py doesn't implement logos yet

        + packaged for Archlinux
        + began process of updating decade old program
        + added installer

Version 0.3, October 15, 2002
        + Support for multiple check layouts.
        + Quicken/QuickBooks compatible check layouts.
        + EPS logo support
        + New check blank definitions, MVD3003 and MVP3001.
        + PostScript string substitution proc
        % modified FixMICR to use new string substitution proc
        * fixed bug where defaults would override the command line
        * fixed bug where ShowAndCR would leave arguments on the stack
        * modified some loops to use repeat since they where not
          using the index number that was being pushed on the stack by
          'for' and were not popping it off either.


Version 0.21, August 12, 2000
        % Changed the way the MICR line is generated & entered
          (See the freecheck.cfg file for details - it's changed)
          Previous algorithm was not flexible enough to generate
          many MICR lines out there.  Should now handle all cases.
        + Added MICR line error checking - routing number checksum, etc.
          (Disabled with --test option)

Version 0.2, July 22, 2000
        + Added error checking for nonexistant acct/style/blank
        + Added options to show available accts/styles/blanks
        + Added centimeter ("cm") def - dims can now be in cm
        % Changed style section definition a bit (no "CheckHeight mul")
        + Added --cgi option to pass config from another script (cgi)
        + Added simple cgi script to accomplish above interface...
        +   cgi script uses cookies to save parameters
        * Strip whitespace from end of lines in config file
        + Replace dash ("-") in account number with dash symbol, if entered
        + Made number of digits in check number configurable (leading 0's)
          Cleaned up PostScript a bit:
        %       Prints acct number left of routing number for large checks
                (and changed logic around check number string a bit)
        -       Removed commented-out sections
        *       Only prints stub when check body is printed
        *       Only prints check border lines if --test requested

Version 0.1, July 16, 2000
        First semi-distributed version
