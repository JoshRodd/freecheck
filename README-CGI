The freecheck.cgi script is a simple web interface to the freecheck application.

To use it, place freecheck.cgi, freecheck, and freecheck.cfg in a directory
from which your web server can execute scripts (cgi-bin/).

You may need to edit the script just a bit - if you want to use the PDF output
feature, edit the $GS variable at the top of freecheck.cgi to point to your
GhostScript executable.

For some reason, Netscape (and Mozilla) under Linu don't auto-load the returned
PDF or PS file, even if you have an application set up - it always want to save
"freecheck.cgi" - I don't know why.  You can just rename the file... if someone
can figure this out, please let me know.  :-)
